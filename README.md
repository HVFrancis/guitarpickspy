# guitarpickspy
A project I'm working on to teach myself Python, based on a series of assignments I gave my Java programming class

## Overview

In 2020 I gave students in my Java Programming class a series of assignments to apply object-oriented programming
to something they could releate to. On the first day of class I asked them to make a list of the things they collect
and to identify some of the properties that distinguish them from each other. This became the basis for their first
class, and what followed were additional assingments to apply slection statements, "has-a" relationships, collections and loops,
inheritence, file processing, etc. 

I worked that project with them (that work might be posted here sometime), but as I was teaching a Python class for the
first time, I decided rewriting that project in Python would be an excellent way for me to better understand Python.
That's what this project is.

As I'm still learning Python myself, I welcome any comments that would help me improve my use of Python. (I don't know
if my work is using appropriate Python convensions... *just because I can do something doesn't mean I should.*)
